# ChatGPT Tab UI

A Chrome extension that transforms the ChatGPT interface into a tabbed view. Instead of scrolling through a long conversation history, each user query and response pair is organized into its own tab, making navigation and focus much easier.

## Features

- **Tabbed Interface**: Automatically converts linear conversations into tabs.
- **Smart Titles**: Tabs are named after the user's question (truncated for readability).
- **Focus Mode**: View one interaction at a time without distractions.
- **Native Look & Feel**: Designed to blend seamlessly with the ChatGPT UI.
